# Bonus Task 1: Edit Validator Description on testnet.storyscan.app

Go to my validator profile link & adit the details.

## Steps Taken:

1. Accessed the Story Protocol explorer at https://testnet.storyscan.app/validators/storyvaloper133n4ss3r9tyjf022llg99ctat0s6ulhf9q5kn5

2. Then clicked on the "Edit" button next to my validator's information.

4. In the edit form, I updated the following information:
   - Moniker: KygoCLAN
   - Details: KygoCLAN : We are a clan of noob validators trying to secure a network by providing node services.
   - Added github, photo & email also.

5. THEN i submitted the transaction to verify it onchain.

6. I verified that the changes were reflected on the explorer by revisiting my validator's page.

This task allowed me to personalize my validator's information on the Story Protocol explorer, making it more identifiable and showcasing my enthusiasm for the project.
